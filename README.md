## Description of Repo!!
This is a Language Identification tool deployed on Flask . It is a simple Language prediction tool so don't mind if it gives you wrong results but it works real fine and have long way to go. The project evaluates the result for different model on 3 different algorithm.

The project have 2 sav file:
- unigram_model.sav which has logistic regression as a classification algorithm. it is a unigram feature model.
- unigram_model_rfc.sav which has random forest classifier as a classification algorithm.

The web folder contains the main code to run the server. you can run it by following command:
```shell
python3 main.py
```


The Requirements have been added in requirements.txt . LI is the virtual environment which you can use for setting uo the project.
Data folder contains the dataset used in the project.
You may see the project demo [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51120790/112991582-e80feb00-9184-11eb-914f-f0741907ae23.mp4)
